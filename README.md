## Author
Emmanuel Bijaoui

## Description
This piece of coursework consists of a mixture of MATLAB and python code, in order to achieve the aims as identified in the MPHY0030 Coursework. The final_submission branch consists of the code to be assessed. The folders themselves are distributed between Part 1 (tasks 1-4 respectively) and Part 2. All images and plots when necessary have built in functions to save them to the users local drive, but reference images have been provided just in caase of malfunction.

## Running the code
All test code and functions should be fully self-contained. MATLAB basic functions were used, and python libraries were used as permitted (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).
